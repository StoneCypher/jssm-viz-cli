# jssm-viz-cli
Command line visualizer for fsl machines, producing SVG flowcharts.

Run the machines with [jssm](https://github.com/StoneCypher/jssm), or visualize within code (instead of at the CLI) with [jssm-viz](https://github.com/StoneCypher/jssm-viz-cli).

Don't mind the mess: this just got started Dec 28 of 2019.  Usable momentarily
